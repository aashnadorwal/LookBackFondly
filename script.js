                <h4>
                This book holds a special place in my heart. Each time I read it, it feels like I'm discovering it all over again. I find myself uncovering new layers of meaning that I had previously overlooked. My interpretations have evolved with each read, influenced by how I've changed as a person over the years. I noticed that different sections began to stand out, resonating with the new perspectives and understanding I had gained. </h4>
                <h4>Seneca's words are as relevant today as they were when he wrote them. This book contains 124 letters written by the Roman philosopher Lucius Annaeus Seneca to his friend and disciple, Lucilius. In my opinion, this book is a must-read for anyone interested in stoicism, philosophy, or simply seeking a deeper understanding of how to live a meaningful life.

                <h3>NOTES:</h3>
                <p>You should neither become like the bad because they are many, nor be an enemy of the many because they are unlike you. Retire into yourself, as far as you can. Associate with people who are likely to improve you. Welcome those whom you are capable of improving. The process is mutual one: men learn as they teach.</p>
                <p>Happy the man who improves other people not merely when he is in their presence but even when he is in their thoughts! And happy, too, is he who can so improve himself as not to be thrown into confusion by the thoughts of others.</p>
                <p>Choose someone whose way of life as well as words, and whose very face as mirroring the character that lies behind it, have won your approval.</p>
                <p>If you shape your life according to nature, you will never be poor; if according to people's opinions, you will never be rich. Nature's wants are small, while those of opinion are limitless.</p>
                <p>Do you think you are the only person to have had this experience? Are you really surprised, as if it were something unprecedented, that so long a tour and such diversity of scene have not enabled you to throw off this melancholy and this feeling of depression?</p>
                <p>How can you wonder your travels do you no good, when you carry yourself around with you? You are saddled with the very thing that drove you away.</p>
                <p>All that dashing about turns out to be quite futile. And if you want to know why all this running away cannot help you, the answer is simply this: you are running away in your own company.</p>
                <p>We should all live with the conviction: "I wasn't born for one particular corner; the whole world's my home country."</p>
                <p>For a person who is not aware that he is doing anything wrong has no desire to be put right. You have to catch yourself doing it before you can reform. So - to the best of your ability - demonstrate your own guilt, conduct inquiries of your own into all the evidence against yourself. Play the part first of prosecutor, then judge and finally of pleader in mitigation. Be harsh with yourself at times. </p>
                <p>A woman is not beautiful when her ankle or arm wins compliments, but when her total appearance diverts admiration from the individual parts of her body. </p>
                <p>No one should feel pride in anything that is not his own. Suppose he has a beautiful home and a handsome collection of servants, a lot of land under cultivation and a lot of money out at interest; not one of those things can be said to be in him - they are just things around him. Praise in him what can neither be given nor snatched away, what is peculiarly a man's.</p>
                <p>Show me a man who isn't a slave; one is a slave to sex, another to money, another to ambition; all are slaves to hope or fear.</p>
                <p>What in fact makes people who are morally unenlightened upset by the experience of physical distress is their failure to acquire their habit of contentment with the spirit. They have instead been preoccupied by the body. That is why a man of noble and enlightened character separates body from spirit and has just as much to do with the former, the frail and complaining part of our nature, as is necessary and no more, and a lot to do with the better, the divine element.</p>
                <p>So long as you carry the sources of your troubles about with you, those troubles will continue to harass and plague you wherever you wander on land or on sea. Does it surprise you that running away doesn't do you any good? The things you're running away from are with you all the time.</p>
                <p>If you wish to be stripped of your vices you must get right away from the examples others set of them. The miser, the swindler, the bully, the cheat, who would do you a lot of harm by simply being near you, are actually within you. Move to better company.</p>
                <p>People who know no self-restraint lead stormy and disordered lives, passing their time in a state of fear commensurate with the injuries they do to others, never able to relax. After every act they tremble, paralyzed, their consciences continually demanding an answer, not allowing them to get on with other things. To expect punishment is to suffer it; and to earn it is to expect it. A guilty person sometimes has the luck to escape detection, but never to feel sure of it.</p>
                <p>No man's good by accident. Virtue has to be learnt. Pleasure is a poor and petty thing. No value should be set on it: it's something we share with dumb animals - the minutest and most insignificant creatures scutter after it. Glory's an empty, changeable thing, as fickle as the weather. Poverty's no evil to anyone unless he kicks against it. Death is not an evil. What is it then? The one law mankind has that is free of all discrimination. Superstition is an idiotic heresy: it fears those it should love: it dishonors those it worships. For what difference does it make whether you deny the gods or bring them into disrepute?</p>
                <p>Philosophy has no business to supply vice with excuses; a sick man who is encouraged to live in a reckless manner by his doctor has not a hope of getting well.</p>

            title: 'All About Love: New Visions by Bell Hooks',
            category: 'Category: Nonfiction Essays',
            date: 'Published: July 22, 2024',
            stars: 'Stars: ★★★☆☆',

                <h4>
                As the title suggests, this book is all about love—familial, platonic, romantic, and self-love. Bell Hooks explores how love is hindered by patriarchy, capitalism, and gender roles. She challenges conventional views and advocates for a more inclusive and compassionate approach to relationships.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                To be honest, I've owned this book for a couple of years, but haven't finished it until now. While Hooks' exploration of love is digestible and insightful, I found it be somewhat generic at times. The discussions on intersectionality, which I hoped would provide a deeper perspective, were limited. However, the book's critique of societal norms and its call for love ethics are thought-provoking and valuable. It's a worthwhile read for those interested in how societal structures affect our understanding of love.
                </h4>
                <h3>NOTES:</h3>
                <p>It is easier to articulate the pain of love's absence than to describe its presence and meaning in our lives.</p>
                <p>Everywhere we learn that love is important, and yet we are bombarded by its failure. </p>
                <p>Everyone assumes that we will know how to love instinctively. Those of us who do not learn how to love among family are expected to experience love in romantic relationships. However, this love often eludes us. And we spend a lifetime undoing the damage cause by cruelty, neglect, and all manner of lovelessness experienced in our families of origin and in relationships where we simply did not know what to do. </p>
                <p>To my child's mind love was the good feeling you got when  family treated you like you mattered. Love was always and only about good feeling.</p>
                <p>Loving justice between a man and a woman does not stand a chance when other men's manhood matters more. When a man has decided to love manhood more than justice, there are predictable consequences in all his relationships with women. </p>
                <p>Learning to live as a man of conscience means deciding that your loyalty to the people whom you love is always more important than whatever lingering loyalty you may sometimes feel to other men's judgement on your manhood. </p>
                <p>Male fantasy is seen as something that can create reality, whereas female fantasy is regarded as pure escape. Men often write about love through fantasy, through what they imagine is possible rather than what they concretely know.</p>
                <p>Spiritual life is first and foremost about commitment to a way of thinking and behaving that honors principles of inter-being and interconnectedness. </p>
                <p>All other spiritual teachings are in vain if we cannot love. Anyone who does not know love is still in death. All awakening to love is spiritual awakening.</p>
                <p>To return to love, to get the love we always wanted but never had, to have the love we want but are not prepared to give, we seek romantic relationships. We believe these relationships, more than any other, will rescue and redeem us. True love does have the power to redeem but only if we are ready for redemption. Love saves us only if we want to be saved.</p>

            title: 'My Body by Emily Ratajkowski',

                <h4>
                To put it simply, I liked this book a lot. Emily Ratajkowski is brutally honest in this collection of self-reflective, intimate, personal essays. She discusses the commodification of her body throughout her career as a model, grappling with her own beauty and objectification in a patriarchal & capitalistic world. She is open about how the objectification of her body has financially benefited her and brought her fame, but she's never considered it true empowerment. </h4>
                <h4>
                The book is full of contradictions, and honestly, it's why I found it so compelling. Emily doesn't present a black-and-white view or gloss over her experiences and choices. Instead, she shares a nuanced and complex relationship with her mind and body, much like the rest of us. If you're interested in a raw and reflective take on these themes, this book is definitely worth reading.
                </h4>

                <h3>NOTES:</h3>
                <p>It had never occurred to me that the women who gained their power from beauty were indebted to the men whose desire granted them that power in the first place. Those men were the ones in control, not the women the world fawned over. Facing the reality of the dynamics at play would have meant admitting how limited my power really was—how limited any woman's power is when she survives and even succeeds in the world as a thing to be looked at</p>
                <p>I know that embracing anger means relinquishing that control, that assessment, that distance from myself, but I am desperate for control. I would rather hurt myself--metaphorically stab myself--than let anyone else hold the knife.</p>
                <p>I do remember that as a young girl I prayed for beauty. I'd lie in bed, squeeze my eyes shut, and concentrate so hard that I broke out in a sweat underneath the covers. I believed that for God to take you seriously, you had to make your mind as blank as possible and then focus on the expanding spots of light behind your eyelids and think only of the one thing you desperately wished for.</p>
                <p>I think of her and the other naked women who line the walls and fill the halls of museums, some so ancient the color has washed from their bodies and their marble heads have fallen off. It would be easy to mistake these displays for symbols of respect, for an honor. But what were their lives? And what were their names? no one remembers.</p>
                <p>The world celebrates and rewards women who are chosen by powerful men.</p>
                <p>I read once that women are more likely than men to cry when they are angry. I know that women cry out of shame. We are afraid of our anger, embarrassed by the way that it transforms us. We cry to quell what we feel, even when it's trying to tell us something, even when it has every right to exist.</p>
                <p>I wonder how many women you've disregarded in your life, written off, because you assumed they had nothing to offer beyond the way they looked. How quickly they learned that the stuff in their heads was of less value than the shape of their bodies.</p>
                <p>How funny that men view the life cycles of women so simply! From sex object to mother to what? Invisibility?</p>
                <p>I thought of my mother's belief that spaces hold memories, that walls take on meaning, that homes become a part of us, just as people do...I wondered whether the more I became a woman and the more space I occupied apart from her, the more she would deteriorate.</p>
                <p>I so desperately craved men's validation that I accepted it even when it came wrapped in disrespect.</p>
                <p>I will proclaim all of my mistakes and contradictions, for all the women who cannot do so, for all the women we've called muses without learning their names, whose silence we mistook for consent. I stood on their shoulders to get here.</p>
                <p>I want to calculate my beauty to protect myself, to understand exactly how much power and lovability I have.</p>

                <h4>
                Dostoevsky offers an exploration of the human psyche, themes of despair, consciousness, and the nature of reality. The narrator is an isolated and bitter man. He finds pleasure in his own suffering, and the intense awareness of his hopelessness. His high self-standards lead him to loathe himself and assume others feel the same. </h4>
                <h4>
                I enjoyed this book for several reasons. The narrator's raw and honest introspection provided a unique perspective on self-awareness and the paradoxes of human consciousness. He's dislikable, bitter & selfish, yet shockingly relatable at times. Dostoevsky’s intense portrayal of human nature is what makes this book so compelling. It’s a challenging read, but a book I’d love to read again.</h4>


                <h3>NOTES:</h3>
                <p>The pleasure of despair. But then, it is in despair that we find the most acute pleasure, especially when we are aware of the hopelessness of the situation... everything is a mess in which it is impossible to tell what's what, but that despite this impossibility and deception it still hurts you, and the less you can understand, the more it hurts.</p>
                <p>How can a man of consciousness have the slightest respect for himself?</p>
                <p>I tell you solemnly, that I have many times tried to become an insect. But I was not equal even to that. I swear, gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness- a real thorough-going illness.</p>
                <p>It is clear to me now that, owing to my unbounded vanity and to the high standard I set for myself, I often looked at myself with furious discontent, which verged on loathing, and so I inwardly attributed the same feeling to everyone.</p>
                <p>I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too.</p>
                <p>But what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure? Answer: Of himself. Well, so I will talk about myself.</p>
                <p>It was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no escape for you; that you never could become a different man; that even if time and faith were still left you to change into something different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you did wish to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality there was nothing for you to change into.</p>
                <p>In despair there are the most intense enjoyments, especially when one is very acutely conscious of the hopelessness of one's position.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I consider myself an intelligent man, only because all my life I have been able neither to begin nor to finish anything. Granted I am a babbler, a harmless vexatious babbler, like all of us. But what is to be done if the direct and sole vocation of every intelligent man is babble, that is, the intentional pouring of water through a sieve?</p>
                <p>In every man’s memories there are such things as he will reveal not to everyone, but perhaps only to friends. There are also such as he will reveal not even to friends, but only to himself, and that in secret. Then, finally, there are such as a man is afraid to reveal even to himself, and every decent man will have accumulated quite a few things of this sort.</p>
                <p>For goodness sake,' they'll cry, 'you cannot argue against it--two times two is four! Nature doesn't consult you; it doesn't give a damn for your wishes or whether its laws please or do not please you. You must accept it as it is, and hence accept all consequences. A wall is indeed a wall. ...' And so on and so forth. Good God, what do I care about the laws of nature and arithmetic if, for one reason or another, I don't like these laws, including the 'two times two is four'? Of course, I cannot break through this wall with my head if I don't have the strength to break through it, but neither will I accept it simply because I face a stone wall and am not strong enough.</p>
                <p>Dreams, as we all know, are very curious things: certain incidents in them are presented with quite uncanny vividness, each detail executed with the finishing touch of a jeweller, while others you leap across as though entirely unaware of, for instance, space and time. Dreams seem to be induced not by reason but by desire, not by the head but by the heart, and yet what clever tricks my reason has sometimes played on me in dreams!</p>
                <p>They did not strive to gain knowledge of life as we strive to understand it, because their lives were full. But their knowledge was higher and deeper than the knowledge we derive from our science; for our science seeks to explain what life is and strives to understand it in order to teach others how to live, while they knew how to live without science.</p>
                <p>Oh, these people were not concerned whether I understood them or not; they loved me without it. But I knew too that they would never be able to understand me, and for that reason I hardly ever spoke to them of it.</p>
                <p>I was overpowered by the mere sensation of that dream and it alone survived in my sorely wounded heart.</p>
                <p>So much have we lost touch with 'real life' that we occasionally feel a kind of disgust for it and so can't bear to be reminded of it. For we have arrived at the point where we look on 'real life' as toil, almost as compulsory service, and all of us privately agree that 'life' as we find it in book is better.</p>
