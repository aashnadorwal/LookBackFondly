## Overview

Hello! This project tracks my reading journey with detailed notes on various books, serving as a personal archive across a range of genres.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this digital bookshelf is to:

1. Organize my thoughts by keeping detailed notes so I can better articulate and retain information from each book.
2. Provide recommendations to other readers, potentially inspiring them to read the books themselves or consider new perspectives.
3. Track my reading journey over time.


Feedback and suggestions are always welcome! If youâ€™d like to contribute or have ideas for improvement, please reach out through the contact form on the website.
